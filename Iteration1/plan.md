PLAN

Introduction:

Our team met together outside of class on Thursday of week 2 to discuss expectations and roles for individual members of the group. We concluded that we should be able to meet twice on a weekly basis, on Mondays and Thursdays. This will allow us to check in to where the other group members are at and allow effective collaboration and review of others' work. We also created a group chat on Messenger so that we can ask questions and check in with each other in-between meetings. We also discussed a potential timeline for the project as a whole, as well as a possible development plan based on the information we have been given so far.
