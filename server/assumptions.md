ASSUMPTIONS

Assumptions about user stories
-Assumed that UNSW's version of slackr would be quite similar to the real slack in terms of its functionality, and possibly its interface.
-Assumed that the features mentioned in Hayden?s ?Stakeholder requirements interview? video are a good overview of the requirements of UNSW?s Slackr (and that UNSW has a good understanding of what the customers want).
-Assumed that the user stories written include almost all of the possible user stories for creating Slackr.

Assumptions about plan
-Planning iteration 1 and iteration 2, deciding the order to implement the functions and the roles of each member of the group.
-We also assume that we should include a diagram to show the timeline week per week (and also that we have 3 weeks to finish this iteration).
-We also assumed that we would keep up the motivation and continue to work well as a term throughout the duration of the project (i.e. not leave it all to the last moment).

Assumptions about specific functions
-message_send and message_sendlater: The authorised user is a member of the channel that the message wants to send.
-ADD MORE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS THAT YOU MADE, WHICH MAYBE WERE NOT IN THE SPEC.
