##Team work

Our team worked well together, as a result of meeting regularly and using various agile 
practices. We met outside of class twice a week on most weeks, and thrice in the week 
before the assignment was due. We met this often because we wanted to have regular 
updates on each otherâ€™s work, and also to possibly help each other out and to ensure 
that we were all working with similar data structures. To ensure our meetings were 
successful, we started them off with a standup, in order to debrief the rest of the group 
on what we had accomplished since the last meeting, as well as what our goals were for 
that particular meeting. Sometimes in meeting, we use the method of pair programming 
to increase the efficiency and improve the code quality.Also, at the end of some of 
our meetings we debriefed what we had accomplished 
and what we planned to next on the task board.

 We faced some hiccups during this iteration, such as various bugs in our code, 
 but with the assistance of the other team members, we were able to work through
 these. We split up the code and worked on our functions separately in different 
 branches of our repo, and then merged them together and ironed out any issues 
 at the end. Our code works well with the front end, and we are proud of what we 
 have achieved during this iteration.
