Our team worked well and in a very similar fashion to how we worked during iteration 2. By the time iteration 3 began, our team members had gotten very comfortable with working collaboratively with each other.

We met once or twice a week, and our meeting times were Monday and Thursday 10-12. We didnâ€™t commit to two meetings every week since we were happy to work on the code ourselves and then message on our group chat/ask each other during our lab time if we had any questions, concerns or updates (such as a new function added to our class).

To ensure our meetings were successful, we started and ended the meetings by discussing with the group what we had accomplished so far, and what we planned to do next. We also updated the task board so that there would be written documentation of our meeting.

During iteration 3, one issue we faced was changing all of our code to be implemented using a class. We decided that using a class structure would be an efficient and compact way of representing and interacting with our data structure. However, once we put our minds to the task and helped each other build on the class representation, we were able to produce code that still passed our autotests and worked with the front end.

Similar to iteration 2, many of us were able to work on our code at the same time using branches in gitlab, as well as resolving merge conflicts when they arose.

Overall, we are very happy with the code and documentation we have produced in this iteration, and have really enjoyed working with each other for the duration of this project.
